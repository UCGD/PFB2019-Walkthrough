## UCGD Programming for Biology Walkthrough

This is a walkthrough of the [PFB2018](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018) course taught at CSHL.

I plan on starting at Python lecture one, which would skip the [Unix](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018/blob/master/unix.md/#unix) and [Git](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018/blob/master/unix.md/#git-for-beginners) sections.  However if you would like to review it, I would be willing to answer any questions via email, slack or in-person.

It would be beneficial if you have python3 installed on your system _before_ we meet the first day, so we have a smooth start. Also I can help with this as needed.

### Time and Location:
* Starts Feb 4th 2019
* Each Following Mondays 2:30-3:30
* Room: [Location](https://github.com/UCGD/PFB2019-Walkthrough/blob/master/MeetingLocation.pdf)

### Format:

This class will be a 'free form' round table approach, where we can learn and discuss together, as opposed to a standing instructor method.  Each week we will cover one Python section, and reserve the last ~10 minutes of class to review the prior weeks problem sets.  I’m assuming the majority of participants will have a intermediate understanding of Python, or prior programming experience, however this class is open for all levels of understanding.
