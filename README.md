## UCGD Programming for Biology Walkthrough

This is a walkthrough of the [PFB2018](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018) course taught at CSHL. This page will be updated weekly.

I plan on starting at Python lecture one, which would skip the [Unix](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018/blob/master/unix.md/#unix) and Git sections.  However if you would like to review it, I would be willing to answer any questions via email, slack or in-person.

It would be beneficial if you have python3 installed on your system _before_ we meet the first day, so we have a smooth start. Also I can help with this as needed.
